üìò GraphQL API Implementation in .NET Core Web API (Hot Chocolate)
üöÄ Introduction
GraphQL is a powerful API query language that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves flexibility, reduces over-fetching, and is especially effective for modern applications where REST becomes limiting.

Benefits:
Type-safe queries.

Single endpoint for all operations.

Supports complex nested data.

High control over data requested.

Strong developer tooling support.

üîß Installation
To get started with GraphQL in ASP.NET Core, install the HotChocolate library:
Install-Package HotChocolate.AspNetCore

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration in ASP.NET Core
Update your Program.cs file as follows:
builder.Services.AddGraphQLServer()
    .AddQueryType<Query>();

app.MapGraphQL();

This sets up the GraphQL server and maps the endpoint at /graphql. You also need to define your GraphQL schema through a class ‚Äî commonly called Query.

Operation Types
GraphQL has three main types of operations:

Operation	Description	REST Equivalent
Query	Retrieve data (read)	GET
Mutation	Modify data (create, update, delete)	POST / PUT / DELETE
Subscription	Real-time data updates	No direct REST equivalent
